# Wasko_CSCI2270_FinalProject
 This project will be similar to most modern music apps with its searching and music organization abilities. Sadly I wonâ€™t be able to create anything that will actually play the music with the time constraints and lack of experience, but I plan on creating an easy to use music organization system. I am the only one working on my project. The program will take in data and organize the data into different trees depending on what I would like to sort by. This way I can create searches for things like genre, length. I will also have a playlist system that allows users to create playlists Along with having their huge libraries. This will all be accessible through an easy to use menu system.

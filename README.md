# Wasko_CSCI2270_FinalProject
 This project will be similar to most modern music apps with its searching and music organization abilities. Sadly I wonâ€™t be able to create anything that will actually play the music with the time constraints and lack of experience, but I plan on creating an easy to use music organization system. I am the only one working on my project. The program will take in data and organize the data into a tree. I will also have a playlist system that allows users to create playlists Along with having their huge libraries. All functions will work with the different Playlists as well as the Library. Users are restricted to 5 playlists, but for right now that will be plenty. This will all be accessible through an easy to use menu system.

=====Instructions=========

-Download the whole "Final_Project_2270" file, this will be the easiest way to get everything you need.

-Open the .cbp file in codeblocks and play around.

-The text file with song data is one I created myself so it only has 10 songs. These songs will automatically be read into the main library. Adding songs to playlists will have to be done manually.

-When choosing menu items please only use numbers. Putting in letters will cause the program to break.(Sorry I don't know how to fix this bug.)
